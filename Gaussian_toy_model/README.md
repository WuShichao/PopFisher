## Gaussian toy model.


The codes in this repository could be used to reproduce the results of Sec. 3.2 of the paper.


The `simplified_FM.nb` Mathematica notebook contains analytical estimates for the Fisher matrix only assuming the first term in the Fisher matrix (Eq. 48). The predictions are used in Fig. 2.

The `Gaussian_toymodel.ipynb` and `Gaussian_toymodel_selection_effects.ipynb` notebooks contain, respectively, the MCMC analsysis without and with selection effects. Fig.1 (generated data) is reproduced in the latter notebook, while Fig.2 is a combination of results from both.
